# Object focused camera system

This is an object focused camera system created using the modern OpenGL (version 3.3) api.
Currently you can strafe left and right, and look from up and below using the standard keyboard keys

<ul>
  <li>strafe left using left-arrow key</li>
  <li>strafe right using right-arrow key</li>
  <li>look from up (increase height of camera) up-arrow key</li>
  <li>look from down (decrease height of camera) down-arrow key</li>
</ul>

The camera is set at (0, 2, 2) in world coordinates at start.<br>The textured cube (Created using OpenGL) is the focus of the camera.<br><br>
